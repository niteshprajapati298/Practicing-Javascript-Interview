   // What is chaining ->
/* Chaining in JavaScript means calling multiple methods on the same object
  in a single statement,because each method returns the object
 (or another chainable value). Itâ€™s common in arrays, promises, and libraries like jQuery. */

  // Lexical Scoping ->
  /*
Why is it called Lexical?
 
Because the scope is decided at the time of writing code (lexically), not at runtime.
No matter where you call the function, it always remembers the scope in which it was defined. 


*/

/* Lexical scoping in JavaScript means that functions are executed using the
 variable scope from where they were defined, not from where they are called */
